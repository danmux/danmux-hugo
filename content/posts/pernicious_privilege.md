Today I was upsettingly reminded of my built in privilege. It transpires this is something that I thought I was more aware of and in control of than I actually am.

<!--more-->

tl;dr - I got schooled.. no that is too flippant, I was called out for being a dick. Or I hope, mistaken for one. The call out was good, the nature of how It was done is irrelevant, the sentiment was valid.

# The Fuckup.

Kris, a well respected engineer, especially in the k8s and security world, that I and many others hold in high esteem mentioned the pain of losing a much loved dog, it was personal and intense, and it reminded me of the anguish I felt at the loss of Finn - our first dog.

Following folk online has a tendency to lull you into a false sense of intimacy with them. I have followed Kris or known about their work for a while.

That false intimacy coupled with such heartfelt and distressed content which I strongly associated with, created a burst of emotion in me where I felt driven to reply, so I did.

(Let me make this clear though, Kris has never engaged with me before in any capacity, we had no previous communication.)

I have only replied to a stranger once before, when I felt I understood their anguish: A distant contact who was using suicidal language, I felt compelled to reach out then too. That time it went a little better. 

On comparing that episode to today’s mistake, I think there was one key difference:
Advice, in particular the unsolicited kind.

In response to Kris’ extremely personal and raw, tragedy, I replied:

>Fuck. This is hard. The pain. Its an inevitable consequence of the love. The loss is so intense we sometimes feel like we never want to face it again. I'll love a dog again, and ill feel the pain of their death again, I'm ok with that. I hope you will be too, let another in
 
# Unsolicited Advice.

Unsolicited Advice is almost never welcome. Unsolicited advice from a stranger, makes it 10x less welcome. Unsolicited advice from a stranger, about an extremely personal and raw, tragedy, 100x less than that.

And that is what I did, I didn’t realise it at the time, but that is what it was, a reply with advice made a 1000 times worse.

Kris railed against that reply. It was clear that I had made a really bad mistake. No one like Kris communicates in the way they did without good reason, however I was completely taken by surprise. I felt my heart beating harder when I read the reply and realised how Kris was feeling, that coupled with my own memories of our lost dog, It was too much, I got upset.

I know what my *intention* was and it did not fit the reaction. I re-read my reply, and then… fuckit...I saw what Kris saw! Shit, what now? Explaining my intentions, or clarifying my reply, was not the right thing to do. I just needed to recognise I had fucked up, so that is all I felt I could do.

I am putting this down in this post not to make Kris, or anyone think any better of me, or as any sort of justification, but simply as a learning tool, to drive it home to myself, to admit the need for personal change out there in public.

# Privilege.

The type of privilege that in its essence is not even being aware of it. Josh Amaechi introduces the concept, with respect to race, nicely [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbPJfxRYmCg&ab_channel=KristenTassin) I think that was produced for a UK kids program, but many adults I know would benefit from watching it! The concept applies to all aspects of discriminatory biases.

I try to be conscious of my biases, and take positive steps to offset them. During my last job change I specifically sought a company who was committed to equality across the board, and was aware of the negative effects of unconscious (or worse still) conscious biases in particular.

This privilege is a type of bias and is closely related to entitlement, the idea that you can just do the thing you want to because you ‘just can’, and not in a good way, it’s not a right, or basic human need. Entitlement in this context is something that is likely to detriment someone else, but you just instinctively do, without thought for it’s impact, and entirely oblivious to the reasons you have this belief.

I’m saying all this because I thought of myself as ‘one of the good people’ (I suppose that is a bit vacuous, surely we all think that), but the reality is, though I may well be better than some, I and probably all of us, still have some nasty inbuilt entitlement that can easily bubble up and betray your ingrained self.

Even writing this, is an example of kind of privilege. I’m making it about me and my view, and I’m free to express it, controversial, or, in this case, uncontroversial. I feel like I have a safe platform to open my thoughts for criticism and review, but it’s all low risk. I don’t expect this is ever going to be used against me, or dug up as part of a background profiling check, yet there are millions of others who are not afforded the same sense of freedom.

In this case my inbuilt privilege made it second nature that describing my own mechanisms to handle a similar situation as a way to help. Even assuming that anything I had to say would be helpful, is a consequence of how I perceive myself and where I fit in. I think I matter enough to everyone that a stranger would happily want to hear my opinion on one of their most sad moments.

# Realisation.

A few minutes after the shock of realising I had totally missed the mark, but still had not understood why, Kris spelled it out and directly quoted this part of my reply :

> “let another in” 

Saying:

> “Do not tell me what to do.”

I re-read my original reply, and that was an ooh fuck moment! I understood my mistake, and I recognised the emotion, and I felt extremely bad for how I had made Kris feel. OK I cried.

I’ll attempt to explain the intention in my reply. I did not want to explain this earlier because it is important to understand how my raw, unexplained reply was taken, and how any reader may have taken it the same way. 

I think if I had changed it subtly, it would have been truer to my intent, but it would have been a different thing, and ultimately it would not have changed a great deal, so this is **NOT** a justification.

My overriding feelings were two fold:
* Solidarity in the face of similar heartbreaking loss.
* Encouragement that it will still be better to love again and face inevitable loss, than to avoid the loss.

I felt sad that Kris may never have another dog again, and I felt it would be good to share that it is good and ok to get to a place where they could be open to another dog.

So if I had changed: 

> I'll love a dog again, and ill feel the pain of their death again, I'm ok with that. I hope you will be too, let another in.

To:

> I'll love a dog again, and ill feel the pain of their death again, I'm ok with that. I hope you will be able to let another in.

Whilst that would have explained my thoughts better, and would have been less advisory, it really makes no difference…

# Who Gives a Fuck

Who cares one ounce whether I, a complete stranger, thinks that Kris will be worse off without another dog, just because getting another dog worked for us.

Kris later referred to me as a “Reply Guy” - I didn’t actually know the reference, I could kind of guess at the meaning. Dictionary dot com [says](https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/reply-guy/):

> A reply guy is a term for a man who frequently comments on tweets or other social media posts in an annoying, condescending, forward, or otherwise unsolicited manner. 

That is exactly what I had done. 

Just because it was mentioned on a public platform, does not mean anyone has the right to reply in a “forward” and “unsolicited” manner. No one asked my opinion and this was a deeply personal message, In hindsight Kris’ message was maybe directed at the community of more intimate followers, or simply a projection into the void, like screaming from the top of a mountain.

Imagine in that situation, a stranger coming up to you and saying: "when I feel like this I have a nice cup of tea". "Get fucked", would be too kind a response. The very act of offering advice in this context is going to be condescending. Perfect! all four boxes ticked.

Kris was right. I was the douche.

It doesn’t really matter whether my “heart was in the right place” at the time of my reply, I still outright put a comma in there and ended with “let another in”, and it was only after getting robustly called out, that I recognised mine as a reply from someone I don’t want to be.

Half a century of white cis male bias is harder to reprogram than I thought (who knew!) and I deserved to be pulled up. 

I want to keep learning and keep changing, and I consciously take efforts to make that happen. If I can also not fuck people off in the process as well, then that would be great.

Sorry Kris.
